# Standing rules for Claude sessions on this repo

Auto-loaded into every session. **Read `NOTES.md` before doing anything** — it
is the source of truth: the "Next capability release" queue (top items first),
settled design decisions, and measured gotchas that must not be re-learned.

## Release flow (the owner's hard gate)
- `main` == production (jefferson-photo-studio.pages.dev, deployed on push).
- The `staging` branch deploys to staging.jefferson-photo-studio.pages.dev.
  Every product change goes: designated `claude/*` branch → push to `staging`
  → the owner's on-device pass → his explicit go → PR + merge to `main`.
  Never merge a product change to main without that go. Docs-only changes
  (NOTES.md, this file) may merge without the gate.
- Push to `staging` UNPROMPTED whenever work reaches a point the owner needs
  to test AND no other branch is already waiting for his go to `main` — don't
  make him ask; that's what staging is for (owner rule, 2026-07-13). Staging
  may be force-pushed: its history is disposable, but check first that every
  staging-only commit is already contained in `main` (`git cherry`).
- Parallel sessions happen. Before pushing anywhere, fetch and check what
  `main` and `staging` actually contain — a roadmap item may have shipped
  from another session mid-work (it happened 2026-07-13: two sessions built
  the same icon probe; one had already merged the full picker).
- Merge PRs with **rebase** — main's history is linear, and the in-app patch
  notes are the last 5 commits; a merge commit would show up in them.
- A branch whose PR merged must be restarted from `origin/main` (same name).
- Bump `public/sw.js` CACHE (`ips-vN`) on EVERY behavior change — including
  icon/asset art, which keeps its filenames and is cached cache-first, so
  without a bump installed apps keep the old bytes forever.
- Versioning: the `VERSION` file declares the base; point releases are
  automatic from commit counts. No git tags — the remote refuses tag pushes.

## Commit messages are the product
Commit subjects/bodies are the in-app patch notes, read by end users from the
ⓘ dialog. Write them for the END USER — what changed for them, not how.

## Verify before claiming fixed
- Headless Chromium harness: `npm install --no-save esbuild playwright-core`;
  the browser binary is the `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` symlink.
- Scratch harnesses live OUTSIDE the repo, in the session scratchpad.
- Playwright `waitForFunction` does NOT await Promise predicates — a Promise
  object is truthy, so such a poll "passes" instantly. Poll synchronous DOM
  state (progress text, banner text) instead.
- Make a new test FAIL once before trusting it.
- When a result looks absurd, suspect the instrument first.
- Walk the primary user journey from the start screen before any handoff.
- State plainly what was VERIFIED (headless, request inspection) versus what
  NEEDS THE OWNER'S HANDS on the real iPad (share sheet, pinch feel, install
  flows, Safari-only storage behavior — all measurements so far are Chromium).

## The owner
- iPad-first, often driving. One step at a time; no desktop-required steps
  unless every alternative is exhausted. No drafts or pseudo-code — iterate
  privately, deliver finished work.
- Session repo access is fixed at session creation (source picker); it cannot
  be added from the iPad mid-session.
- Taste: maximum saturation, gentle contrast, shadows alive; direct
  manipulation; modes announce themselves and offer an obvious exit; one
  gesture = one undo step; labels stay honest; every failure explains itself
  and offers a way forward. Product values: free, on-device, offline-first,
  no account, no install required.

## Icon pipeline
PNG touch icons are generated from the SVG via a headless-Chromium screenshot
(the `macro-icon-180.png` pipeline; generator scripts live in the session
scratchpad). Regenerate PNGs whenever the SVG changes — and bump the cache.
