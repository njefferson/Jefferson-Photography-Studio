# Infrared Photography Studio (IPS) — Project Notes

> Captured from Noah's description and refined as the project progressed.
> Date captured: 2026-06-17

## What this is

An app for editing **infrared (IR) photographs** using the **color-IR
channel-swap method**. The core involves **color swaps and hue shifts**,
particularly pushing **white balance below the range a typical white-balance
control normally allows** — the move that ordinary editors (Lightroom) can't do
because they floor temperature at ~2000K.

## Goals

- **Eventual target:** publish to the **Apple App Store**.
- **Acceptable starting point:** a **web app** that runs on the **iPad in
  desktop mode**.

## Inputs / files

- Works with **JPG and RAW**.
- **Primary interest is RAW editing.**
- RAW arrives as **Nikon NEF** (native) and **DNG** (lossy-linear and mosaiced).
- Files are stored in **Lightroom**, but can be exported to **Photos** or
  **Files**.

## Desired workflow / UI

1. **Open a file** and **see the image**.
2. **Set white balance** by either:
   - **Tapping** a point on the image, or
   - **Dragging a selector** to find the best white balance (preferred).
3. Press **buttons that correspond to the channel swaps / hue shifts**.
4. **Save the edited image back to the device**, at **native resolution or
   lower by user's choice**.

## Open requests from Noah

- **Help avoid common pitfalls.**
- Do **not** want pseudo code or drafts — wants it run through **review passes
  until it is as good as it can be**.

## Confirmed

- Camera: **Nikon Z50, IR-converted**. Filters tested: **red, 530nm, 720nm,
  none**. Red gives the most color; 720nm is near-monochrome ("white forest").
- Input formats validated on the real files:
  - **Lossy linear DNG** (8-bit, baseline-JPEG tile) — decodes natively.
  - **Mosaiced DNG** (14-bit, lossless-JPEG, Bayer) — pure-JS LJ92 decoder
    **verified bit-exact** vs LibRaw.
  - **Nikon NEF** (14-bit, Compression 34713 = Nikon compressed) — needs its
    own decoder (Nikon Huffman + linearization curve + predictor).
- Output: **JPEG q92 Display P3** + **16-bit TIFF**; also **export `.dcp`/`.cube`
  for Lightroom/Photoshop** generated from the in-app edit (the user's own look,
  no third-party IP).
- Platform: **offline-first PWA**, iPad A3355 (A16); native App Store build later.
- Confirmed the sub-2000K white-balance crux on a real file (needed gains
  R 0.42 / G 7.8 / B 2.1 — impossible in Lightroom, trivial in our pipeline).
- Noted IR **lens vignette/hot-spot** in some frames (shooting-side issue).

See **`PLAN.md`** for the full build plan.

## Status

- [x] Confirm scope and stack
- [x] Identify pitfalls (esp. RAW + sub-range white balance in a web app)
- [x] Validate DNG decode + WB + swap on real files
- [x] Phase 1: scaffold + hardened import + WebGL edit pipeline
- [x] True raw decode: native lossy-linear-DNG path (unbounded WB)
- [x] Verify pure-JS lossless-JPEG (LJ92) decoder bit-exact vs LibRaw
- [x] Port LJ92 decoder to TypeScript + demosaic (mosaiced DNG) — bit-exact
- [x] Nikon NEF decoder (Compression 34713) — bit-exact, ~0.8s full frame in JS
- [ ] Export images, then `.dcp`/`.cube` profiles
- [ ] Full-resolution export-quality demosaic (current proxy is 2x2 binned)
